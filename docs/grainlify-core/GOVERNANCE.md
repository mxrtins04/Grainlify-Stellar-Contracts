# Grainlify Governance System

## Overview

The Grainlify governance system enables decentralized decision-making for contract upgrades through proposals, authenticated voting, quorum checks, and approval thresholds. Governance configuration explicitly selects either one-person-one-vote or token-weighted voting.

## Key Parameters

- **Voting Period:** Duration during which votes can be cast.
- **Execution Delay:** Time-lock period after a proposal is approved before it can be executed.
- **Quorum:** Minimum percentage, in basis points, of the scheme-specific total voting power that must participate.
- **Approval Threshold:** Minimum percentage, in basis points, of non-abstaining voting power that must vote `For`.
- **Minimum Proposal Stake:** Minimum balance of the configured governance token required to create a proposal.
- **Governance Token:** Soroban token address used for token-weighted voting and proposal-stake checks.
- **Token Total Voting Power:** Total token voting power used as the denominator for token-weighted quorum. This should match the selected snapshot or stake-lock set.

## Voting Power

### OnePersonOneVote

`OnePersonOneVote` assigns every authenticated voter a constant voting power of `1`. The contract prevents the same address from voting more than once on the same proposal.

Because the contract does not maintain an on-chain voter registry, quorum for this scheme is calculated against `one_person_total_voters` from `GovernanceConfig`. Deployments must keep this value aligned with the eligible electorate.

### TokenWeighted

`TokenWeighted` derives each vote's `voting_power` by reading the voter's balance from the configured governance token contract at vote time:

```text
voting_power = governance_token.balance(voter)
```

The contract rejects votes with zero voting power. Token-weighted quorum is calculated against `GovernanceConfig::token_total_voting_power`, which should represent the total governance-token power eligible at the selected snapshot or stake-lock point.

## Snapshot And Balance Semantics

The standard Soroban token interface exposes current balances, not historical balances. `GovernanceConfig::snapshot_ledger` records the ledger selected by governance policy for a snapshot or stake-lock process, but the contract cannot independently query historical token balances from a normal token contract.

Production token-weighted governance should use one of these mitigations:

- Lock voting stake for the full voting window before proposals can be voted on.
- Use a governance token wrapper that exposes snapshot balances for the configured snapshot ledger.
- Ensure token supply and transferable balances cannot be cheaply manipulated during the voting window.

Without one of these controls, a voter may temporarily acquire tokens, vote, and transfer them away before finalization. The contract mitigates zero-balance voting and uses the configured token address for all reads, but current-balance voting alone does not prevent flash-loan style power inflation.

## Governance Flow

1. **Proposal Creation**
   - The proposer must authorize the call.
   - If `min_proposal_stake > 0`, the proposer must hold at least that much of the configured governance token.
   - Voting starts immediately upon creation.

2. **Voting Period**
   - Eligible voters cast `For`, `Against`, or `Abstain`.
   - The contract derives voting power according to the configured voting scheme.
   - Each address can vote once per proposal.
   - Zero-power votes are rejected.

3. **Finalization**
   - After the voting period ends, anyone can call `finalize_proposal`.
   - Quorum is checked against the scheme-correct total voting power.
   - Approval threshold is checked against `For + Against` voting power, excluding abstentions.
   - If quorum is not met, the proposal is stored as `Rejected`.

4. **Execution**
   - Approved proposals enter the configured execution delay before upgrade execution.
   - Execution logic should preserve the existing time-lock and audit requirements.

## Security Features

- **Authenticated Voting:** `require_auth()` is called for voters and proposers.
- **Double-Voting Prevention:** Each address can vote only once per proposal.
- **Configured Token Reads:** Token-weighted power and stake checks use only `GovernanceConfig::governance_token`.
- **Zero-Power Rejection:** Accounts with no scheme-valid voting power cannot vote.
- **Quorum Enforcement:** Participation is checked before approval threshold math.
- **Time-locked Upgrades:** The execution delay provides a safety buffer for stakeholders to react to approved changes.
- **Minimum Stake Requirement:** Proposal creation can require governance-token ownership, preventing spam proposals by requiring a significant commitment from the proposer.
- **Immutable Logic:** Proposals cannot be modified once created.
- **Action-Bound Multisig Execution:** Multisig upgrade proposals store the exact `ProposalAction::Upgrade(wasm_hash)` that signers approve. The `execute_upgrade` entrypoint replays that stored action in one call and marks the proposal executed only after the WASM update call is made.
- **Signer/Threshold Snapshots:** Each multisig proposal snapshots the signer set and threshold at creation time. Later configuration changes cannot retroactively make a pending proposal executable or authorize a signer that was not part of the original proposal.
- **Replay Protection:** Executed proposals reject further approvals and cannot be executed a second time.

## Multisig Upgrade Execution

The multisig upgrade path is intentionally payload-bound:

1. `propose_upgrade(proposer, wasm_hash)` creates a multisig proposal whose action is `Upgrade(wasm_hash)`.
2. `approve_upgrade(proposal_id, signer)` records approvals against the proposal's original signer snapshot.
3. `execute_upgrade(proposal_id)` verifies the proposal is not executed, confirms the stored action is the expected upgrade payload, checks the proposal snapshot threshold, performs `update_current_contract_wasm(wasm_hash)`, and then stores `executed = true`.

This removes the previous decoupling between approval and effect. A proposal can no longer be marked executed without the approved action being run, and callers cannot execute a different WASM hash than the one signers approved.

## Single-Admin Upgrade Timelock

The direct single-admin `upgrade(wasm_hash)` path is a two-step schedule/execute flow. This keeps the emergency admin route available while adding a mandatory observation window before contract code can change.

1. The admin may call `set_upgrade_delay(delay_seconds)` to configure the delay. The contract rejects values below the documented minimum of 300 seconds. If no value is set, the default delay is 86,400 seconds.
2. The admin calls `schedule_upgrade(wasm_hash)`. The contract stores one active scheduled hash with `scheduled_at` and `executable_at = scheduled_at + delay_seconds`.
3. `upgrade(wasm_hash)` can execute only when the active schedule exists, the supplied hash exactly matches the scheduled hash, and the current ledger timestamp is at or after `executable_at`.
4. Early execution is rejected with `Upgrade timelock not elapsed`; hash mismatch is rejected with `Scheduled upgrade hash mismatch`.
5. A later `schedule_upgrade` call replaces the active schedule, so operators can cancel a pending upgrade by scheduling the intended replacement hash and waiting for its delay.

The contract emits `upg_sch` when an upgrade is scheduled and `upg_exec` when the scheduled upgrade executes. Indexers should track these events together with the existing monitoring metrics to audit single-admin upgrade intent and execution.

## TODO / Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate with a native Soroban token for precise `TokenWeighted` voting power.
- [ ] Implement a dynamic quorum based on historical participation.
- [ ] Add a formal "veto" mechanism for high-stakes upgrades.
